# Static Comp Challenge
---
The Static Comp Challenge serves to introduces the idea of using media queries and other tools to achieve a fully dynamic website. With the mobile device world becoming way more popular for web browsing, it no longer makes sense to develop for desktops first, and worry about other devices later. At this point there is an argument to be made of how Mobile should really be the first priority in development, the age of the desktop is quickly going away.
